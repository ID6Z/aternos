### afkserviceforaternos
This is a self-running inactive bot for 24/7 Minecraft server hosted by Aternos.

# GUIDE

To run this service, update the server information in file `config.json`.

Then, open your IDE with this folder, open the **Terminal**, type **`npm install`** (make sure you installed NodeJS). The step above will install all the dependencies for the bot.

Finally, type **`node index.js`** to execute.

# Aware: The bot will automatically turn off if you close the IDE or shutdown the computer. So in order to perform 24/7, I recommend deploy it on HEROKU(free) or a paid VPS service for the best experiences.
